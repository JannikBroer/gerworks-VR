IMPORTANT:

This license has some dubious provisions and is nonfree. In
particular, the nonviolence provision, despite good
intentions is bad news for a permissive or free license.
Vaguely worded in the copyright legal sense.  The "bruising
egos" note doesn't have legal value and doesn't belong in a
license to begin with.

The "competing library" clause is just bad news for an
non-viral implicit grant...

In case you want to get rid of it as dependency, delete
`libopentrack-tracker-wii' from your `modules` directory.
That'll get rid of all uses of this library, and the license
will no longer be in force.

When building opentrack from source, you can also add
add `if(FALSE) as the first line of
`tracker-wii/CMakeLists.txt` and `endif()` as the last line.
That will prevent building the library altogether, making the
license also not apply.

In plain terms, deleting `libopentrack-tracker-wii` will get
rid of ALL references to the WiiYourself library.  The terms
will be null and void in that build.

I hope the license only applies when the code is actually
used, not merely linked into a process.
